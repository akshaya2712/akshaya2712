# Portfolio Project: Online Retail Exploratory Data Analysis with Python
## Overview
In this project, you will step into the shoes of an entry-level data analyst at an online retail company, helping interpret real-world data to help make a key business decision.
## Case Study
In this project, you will be working with transactional data from an online retail store. The dataset contains information about customer purchases, including product details, quantities, prices, and timestamps. Your task is to explore and analyze this dataset to gain insights into the store's sales trends, customer behavior, and popular products. 
By conducting exploratory data analysis, you will identify patterns, outliers, and correlations in the data, allowing you to make data-driven decisions and recommendations to optimize the store's operations and improve customer satisfaction. Through visualizations and statistical analysis, you will uncover key trends, such as the busiest sales months, best-selling products, and the store's most valuable customers. Ultimately, this project aims to provide actionable insights that can drive strategic business decisions and enhance the store's overall performance in the competitive online retail market.
## Project Objectives
1. Describe data to answer key questions to uncover insights
2. Gain valuable insights that will help improve online retail performance
3. Provide analytic insights and data-driven recommendations
## Tasks
You may explore this dataset in any way you would like - however if you'd like some help getting started, here are a few ideas:
1. Load the dataset into a Pandas DataFrame and display the first few rows to get an overview of the data.
2. Perform data cleaning by handling missing values, if any, and removing any redundant or unnecessary columns.
3. Explore the basic statistics of the dataset, including measures of central tendency and dispersion.
4. Perform data visualization to gain insights into the dataset. Generate appropriate plots, such as histograms, scatter plots, or bar plots, to visualize different aspects of the data.
5. Analyze the sales trends over time. Identify the busiest months and days of the week in terms of sales.
6. Explore the top-selling products and countries based on the quantity sold.
7. Identify any outliers or anomalies in the dataset and discuss their potential impact on the analysis.
8. Draw conclusions and summarize your findings from the exploratory data analysis.
